							<p align="justify"></br>Popular with students, this yakitori joint imbues a rather soulless unit off Oxford Road (the main university drag) with the warmth of Japanese comfort food. It’s not a complex proposition: yakitori skewers come laden with, for example, chicken meatballs, quail eggs or enoki mushrooms wrapped in pancetta (order three of the sticks and you get rice thrown in). There’s also a small list of snacks served alongside steaming donburi bowls. Bubbly-crisp, deep-fried chicken karaage arrives strewn with red chilli and accompanied by lime and Kewpie mayo, while salmon teriyaki donburi comes with a perfectly soft-boiled egg and spears of steamed asparagus. Service is basic but sunny, and seating is on communal benches. Helped by the student hubbub, the vibe here is a mix of old and new: a wall-mounted TV screen and constant radio soundtrack contrasting with the traditional drapes that screen off the open kitchen.
