												<p align="justify"></br>The GRUB food fair is the biggest food fair in Manchester, which brings street food vendors from across the UK to Manchester, every Friday and Saturday. On their 'Plant Powered Sundays', they provide an all vegan line up for all you vegans out there! As well as street food, they provide a full bar, have retro gaming consoles and board games, and have DJs playing from open to close. At the start of each month, they release a monthly calendar which lists all the street food vendors who are coming. A few of my favorites include the Ottomen, which sell fresh and delicious mezze boards; The Gravy Train who bring an authentic taste of Canada with their poutine dishes; Purely Pizza who make truly amazing Italian woodfired pizzas (I recommend the Margherita!) and finally Oh Mei Dumpling, who has spent years working her dumpling recipes to the point of perfection! There is usually also one dessert stall each day which is always a winner! GRUB is truely an amazing casual dining experience and if you're a real 'foodie', it is definitely for you!

										<h2>Mackie Mayor</h2>

											<div class="introtext">
											<p align="justify"></br>Mackie Mayor is a real hidden gem found in Manchester's Northern Quarter. Located in a 1858 Grade II listed market building, it is home to many food vendors such as Honest Crust Pizza, Fin Fish Bar, La Cucina, Tender Cow, Baohouse, and Rotisserie. The food here is a little more on the pricey side but it is worth it for the quality. Everything is locally sourced and during the day there are stalls outside that sell fish, meat, veg and cheese, which gives visitors the chance to buy locally and give back to the area. There are also cafes at Mackie Mayor, with Atkinson's standing out in particular for it's speciality tea and coffee from all over the world. They have even incorporated these into their cocktails which are 2 for £10 every Tuesday-Thursday. The award winning Reserve wines is also at the market, selling fine wine from around the world, along with Jack in the Box which is a speciality cask ale bar. As well as all these vendors, the quirky and  decorative touches gild the whole must-visit experience at Mackie Mayor.

											<div class="introtext">
														<p align="justify"></br>Hatch MCR is a fairly new collective of independent traders, whether that be in food, drink, or retail. The food traders change every few weeks or so, which offers excitement for the customers by change. A few notable traders who have been here before include - Well Hung! providing the best Philly cheesesteak experience in Manchester, Holy Crab which have the yummiest seafood snacks and are also an oyster bar, and Seasoned: Nothing but Fries who with 20 years in the business, have perfected the dish of loaded fries! There is also Öl which is a nanobrewery providing their own take on beer and also beers from all over the world. Takk espresso bar is another big attraction in the Hatch, which is based on Scandanavian style cafes, and is a speciality coffee house providing brews that you would not find anywhere else in the city! The Hatch's newest addition Eletrik Box is a bar providing 10 different types of draught beer, and has arcade games for you to enjoy whilst having a bev. They also boast that they have the best jukebox in town! Hatch Mcr is definitely an unique experience, which has something for everyone and I would advise anyone visiting the city to check it out!

													<h2>Levenshulme Market</h2>

													<div class="introtext">
													<p align="justify"></br>The Levenschulme market is a community run market that runs every weekend from March to December in Levenschulme. It's also runs every Tuesday at the Univeristy of Manchester, which is how I got to know it. There are many food vendors, and also some stalls which sell local produce and plants. A few of my favorites include North West Game which use local and sustainably sourced game meat to make various burgers and hotdogs, BBQ Events company which make the best grilled cheeses on a good ole barbeque (their vegan option is also really good!), and The Free From Gluten company which provide a wide range of vegan and gluten free cakes and tarts! Nasruddin's Kitchen is also an amazing stall which sells homemade Eastern spice bags, which are sure to spruce up your recipes at home! the Levenschulme Market is more than just a market as it is considered a social enterprise, as they give back to their own community. They have done this in various ways including the Levenschulme Market Fund which awards grants to local people wanting to start a business on the Levenschulme High Street. So if you are interested in good food and a good cause definitely try it out!													<br/> </p>
