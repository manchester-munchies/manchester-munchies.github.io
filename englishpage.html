								  <p align="justify"></br> This Pieminister cafe is located right in the heart of Manchester in Northern Quarter, the perfect spot to visit after hitting the shops. Pieminister has over 15 different award-winning pies to choose from, with various tasty sides. "In Manchester and new to Pieminister? Give the legendary Mothership a try. Originally created for the fields of Glastonbury Festival back in 2004, the Mothership combines your favourite pie on a base of buttery mash, topped with mushy peas, crispy shallots and cheese. Served up with a whole boat of gravy, it’s the ultimate pie feast. Wash it down with a craft ale or one of our ciders for the perfect introduction to Pieminister." A pie I would definitely recommend would be the the 'Chicken of Aragon' which conists of chciken, dry cured bacon and tarragon! They also have a range of gluten free and veggie pies, so if you're looking for a good pie, hit Pieminister up!
